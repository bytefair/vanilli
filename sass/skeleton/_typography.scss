/*
I have created this font-scale-multiple mixin to provide an easier way to
establish a vertical rhythm without all the calculations normally required.
All that's required to set it up is two optional variables, $scale-multiple
and $lines. $scale-multiple is how far up the scale defined in _definition.scss
you want to go with that text block. The second defines the line-height as
multiples of the base-line height. If you do not include a number here, Compass
will automatically determine a non-overlapping multiple. If you hate the idea
of using a standard typographic scale, just delete this code and you can use
all of Compass's vertical rhythm mixins which I've included.

You can chage the typographic scale in _definition.scss as I've included all
common ones. If the only thing you wish to do is change the typographic scale,
then this variable is the only thing you'll need to change. I've chosen perfect
fourth by default since it's harmonious and neutral. Braver souls may choose to
venture up the scale for great drama!
